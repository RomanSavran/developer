Document descrbibed the must have and should have features of Developer Portal. wWe have three milestones:

* Beta by March 11th
* MVP by March 31st

## Alpha


## Beta


## MVP 

"And do please aim for the MVP in that sense that your portal will be also one app on the platform. We talked with Vesa that we would like to have the users setup their:
- very first user account (a regular user account on PoT)
- register first app in the sandbox (become a developer for that)
- build their first Digital twin (in three min)
- get some data flowing linked to that twin

Some of these will be provided by the dev portal"
