# Developer Portal - road to MVP

Document describes the must have and should have features of Developer Portal. wWe have three milestones:  

* Alpha by January 31st
* Beta by March 11th
* MVP by March 31st

## Alpha


## Beta


## MVP 

Aim for the MVP in that sense that your portal will be also one app on the platform. 

### Register for user account (a regular user account on PoT)

- So the frontend has to have register and login/logout buttons. 
- user management by platform service (Gluu?)

### Register first app in the sandbox (become a developer for that)

### Build their first Digital twin (in three min)

### Get some data flowing linked to that twin

Some of these will be provided by the dev portal
