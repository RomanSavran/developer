# Developer Portal - road to MVP

Document describes the must have and should have features of Developer Portal. wWe have four milestones:  

* Pre-alpha Jan 4th 
* Alpha by January 31st
* Beta by March 11th
* MVP by March 31st

## Pre-alpha 

Preparations for full scale development: 
* Road to MVP document
* Known requirements
* Domain
* Server
* Practices clear and documented in Github

## Alpha


## Beta


## MVP 

Aim for the MVP in that sense that your portal will be also one app on the platform. 

### Initial view

- top navigation: (left > right): PoT developer portal (link to beginning/top), documentation, support, contact, register/login 
- layout the steps needed to be productive (create an app): register - build - publish
- Link/call for action: create first app in under 3 minutes (get started package) "0 to 200 in under 3 minutes". 200 is ok response code in REST APIs.  


### Register for user account (a regular user account on PoT)

- So the frontend has to have register and login/logout buttons. 
- user management by platform service (Gluu?)
- with one registration, dev becomes sandbox user too. 

### Register first app in the sandbox (become a developer for that)

- register app (name, description, logo, license, price)

### Build their first Digital twin (in three min)

- answers to question: how to build first app on PoT in under 3 minutes. 

### Get some data flowing linked to that twin

- tools/views to verify that data flows and all is good, success 

Some of these will be provided by the dev portal
