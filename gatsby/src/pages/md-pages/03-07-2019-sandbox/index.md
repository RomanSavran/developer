Platform of Trust sandbox is a self-contained, virtual testing environment that mimics the live Platform of Trust production environment. It provides a shielded space where you can initiate and watch your application process the requests you make to the Platform of Trust APIs without touching any production use data products. 

Likewise for data product owners and integrators, sandbox provides shielded environment to test data products before publishing to market place for application developers to consume.
