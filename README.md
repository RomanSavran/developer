## Purpose and background
Portal is one stop shop for all developers. Developer Portal is part of Developer Program, which is coordinated with help of Trello. 

## For whom? 

* 1st tier – data providers, to enable easy addition of new data source
* 2nd tier - 3rd party application developers (+ managers) be productive in minutes and create the apps for the market
* 3rd tier - Component and tool providers build plugins, SDKs, packages for development frameworks to boost platform adaptation worldwide
* 4th tier - API providers to build functional APIs on top of the data – we provide management and monetization layers to extend platform capabilities. 

## Development practices

We use 2 week sprints. New release after each sprint

Epics are included in issues and are tagged with label ``EPIC``

We use waffle.io in sprint management ([Go to Waffle](https://waffle.io/PlatformOfTrust/developer.oftrust.net)). Waffle is the free and tasty way to plan, track, and organize work in GitHub. Built with everyone on your team in mind, Waffle provides a simple board interface for your GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
