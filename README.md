## Development practices

We use 2 week sprints. New release after each sprint

We use waffle.io in sprint management ([Go to Waffle](https://waffle.io/PlatformOfTrust/developer.oftrust.net)). Waffle is the free and tasty way to plan, track, and organize work in GitHub. Built with everyone on your team in mind, Waffle provides a simple board interface for your GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
